Scikit-learn is open-source software built for data analysis. In particular, it can be used for machine learning. It includes a number of algorithms that can perform a wide variety of data analysis tasks.

Major categories of tasks that scikit-learn commonly used for include:
* Classification of data
* Regression
* Clustering
* Dimensionality reduction (so you donâ€™t need to consider as many random variables)
* Evaluating the efficiency of different models
* Processing input data for another algorithm to use
Note that scikit-learn does NOT support deep learning. 

#### Installation
The latest version requires Python 3.5, NumPy (at least version 1.8.2) and SciPy (at least version 0.13.3). Once you have these installed, you can run the command `pip install -U scikit-learn`
